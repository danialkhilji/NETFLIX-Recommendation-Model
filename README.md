# NETFLIX-Recommendation-Model
This project uses correlation methods to implement NETFLIX movie recommendation model.
The dataset is the NETFLIX competition dataset from Kaggle website.
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data
Due to limited RAM of my machine, I used only "combined_data_1.txt" file from data
along with "movie_titles.csv" file.
This project did a basic data analysis in the Jupyter-Notebook and then used 
pyhton built-in libraries to implement recommendation model of NETFLIX.
The models used are Collaborative Filtering and Pearsons'R correlation.
